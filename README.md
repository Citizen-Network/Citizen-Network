- 👋 Hi, I’m @Citizen-Network
- 👀 I’m interested in programming; such as scripting mods for Grand Theft Auto Series, Creating mods for FiveM, and much more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the LUA, JSON, and C# languages. So for LUA and JSON have been the easiest for me to pick up and understand a bit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FiveM as well as any other mods that might be beneficial or add to the realism, since it's my goal to provide a realistic, fun server.
- 📫 You can contact me by sending an email to CitizenFiveServers@gmail.com
